# Kanban Board Assignment

# About the Project
This project is built using Angular 17, one of the latest versions of Angular. I also used Angular Material to take advantage of its pre-built components and styling options.

For the drag-and-drop functionality, I decided to go with Vanilla JavaScript instead of using a third-party library. This helped keep the build size smaller and the project more lightweight.

# What I Would Improve
If I had more time, I would:

Make the board more responsive so it works better across different screen sizes.
Reduce the use of Angular Material and rely more on plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for styling and components.


# Overall, this project showcases a clean and functional Kanban board while keeping performance in mind.
